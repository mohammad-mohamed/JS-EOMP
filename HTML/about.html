                          Over chatter and Arabian coffee before the meal, I shared the story of how our family’s falafel shop began. My family relocated from Jordan to Cape Town 23 years ago, before I was born. Having no family or acquaintances here, they began making friends in the area and at their school, where my father also taught. They often had friends over for a meal, and a scrumptious Middle Eastern meal was laid out each time. Their friends suggested to my mother that she start a home-based business, so they could purchase her goodies guilt-free. My mother is an incredibly inspirational and selfless woman and she refused to accept money in exchange for any cooking requests initially. Finally, our falafel shop sprung to life on the 1st of August this year.
                          </p>

                          While chatting about the challenges of our relocation, what came out strongly was both my mother’s and my love for our homeland and culture. And of course the Jordanian food. I watched as my mother expertly moulded and fried falafel and brinjal chips. Simultaneously, I was hustling away, brewing mint tea, cutting up veggies to dip with hummus, and toasting pita bread. I suggest you warm the pita bread in the toaster as it helps to puff up nicely. We sell the pitas as part of our offerings too, although my mother does not have the capacity to prepare it herself at present. She does intend to expand her selection in the near future to include labneh and babaganoush.
